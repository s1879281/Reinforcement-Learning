# Reinforcement learning

This is a python implementation of Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

The algorithms are addressing the Half-Field Offence (HFO) problem 
(taken from

* Exercise 1 - Value Iteration.


* Exercise 2 - Q-Learning, SARSA, and first-visit MC control with soft 
policies.


* Exercise 3 - Asynchronous 1-Step Q-Learning.


* Exercise 4 - Independent Q-Learning, Joint Action Learning, and 
WoLF-PHC for discrete multi-agent Reinforcement Learning.
